# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This was our 2nd homework assignment. No Javascript: just the most basic CSS and HTML.
It was my first site, and as pathetic as it is, it serves to show how much I have grown as a developer in just a few months.
Today, I could do this site in my sleep.

Languages used: CSS and HTML
